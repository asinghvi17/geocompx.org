# Introduction

The 2nd edition of [Geocomputation with R](https://r.geocompx.org) is due to be published in early 2024 and we're looking for a new cover image!

This is now the official cover image for Geocomputation with R version 1:

```{r}
nc = sf::st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package="sf"), quiet = TRUE)
plot(nc)
```

# Competition
