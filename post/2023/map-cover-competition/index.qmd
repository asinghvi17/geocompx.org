# Introduction

The 2nd edition of [Geocomputation with R](https://r.geocompx.org) is due to be published in 2024.
Now, we're looking for a new cover image and we'd like your help.
The competition is open to all and we have some prizes (see below).

# A bit of history

[Marco Sciaini](https://marcosci.github.io/) won the competition for the book cover of the first edition of Geocomputation with R.
His winning entry is shown on the left below.
After some [iteration](https://github.com/geocompx/geocompr/issues/284) on this winning idea, the concept was refined, resulting in a reproducible image (see its source code at [github.com/geocompx/geocompr/](https://github.com/geocompx/geocompr/blob/main/code/frontcover.R)) (center).
Then, the image was incorporated into the official cover of the book's first edition (right).
