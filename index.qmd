## Welcome to **geocompx**!

::: {.justify}

Here you will find content, including books and beyond, on reproducible geographic data analysis, modeling, and visualization with open source software.
The project and this website evolved from the website originally created to host content around [Geocomputation with R](https://r.geocompx.org/). 
Since the publication of that book in 2019, the community around the book has grown and now includes a nascent 'geocompy' community and the associated [Geocomputation with Python](https://py.geocompx.org/) open source book project.
It became clear that the 'geocompr' name was no longer appropriate for the more multi-lingual nature of the project. 

After community consultations and much debate, we settled on **geocompx** as a name that captured the essence of the project: *eXchanging information* about geocomputation, *cross (X) pollination of ideas* from one programming language for working with geographic data to another, and the possibility that this website could host additional content on *geocomputation with (X) other languages*.
